# SMBots
An IRC Bot developer in 2009 as a freelance project for Julian Clark and his SmokinMils runescape clan (now defunct)

During my tenure working with Julian Clark, I took on a role in developing a Java-based gambling bot for IRC. This project aimed to provide users with a platform to utilize their fictitious gold earned from the popular online game, Runescape.

# Key Contributions:

1. Spearheaded the entire project independently, building it from scratch using Java and leveraging an API to establish a seamless connection with IRC.
2. Demonstrated effective leadership skills by managing the project as the sole developer, overseeing all aspects of development, including design, implementation, and deployment.
3. Designed and implemented the core functionalities of the gambling bot, such as enabling users to place bets, track winnings, and interact seamlessly with the bot.
4. Ensured the security and integrity of the gambling system by implementing robust input validation, error handling, and incorporating appropriate risk mitigation measures.
5. Despite the absence of unit tests, I rigorously tested the application through comprehensive manual testing and conducted thorough error handling to identify and resolve issues and bugs promptly.
6. Actively participated in regular team meetings, collaborating with stakeholders, sharing project updates, exchanging ideas, and addressing challenges to ensure the project's success.
7. Through this experience, I not only further enhanced my technical skills in Java and API integration but also demonstrated my ability to work independently, deliver a high-quality product, and take ownership of a project from inception to completion.
